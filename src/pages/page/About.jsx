          Hi, I‚Äôm <span className="font-semibold">Nayan Islam</span>, a passionate full-stack developer with a knack for crafting clean, efficient, and impactful applications. My programming journey started out of curiosity‚Äîjust a simple desire to understand how websites worked. That curiosity quickly transformed into late-night coding marathons, countless debug sessions, and the thrill of bringing ideas to life.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Over the years, I‚Äôve explored various technologies, from <span className="font-semibold">Laravel</span> and <span className="font-semibold">MySQL</span> to <span className="font-semibold">React</span>, <span className="font-semibold">Tailwind CSS</span>, and <span className="font-semibold">MongoDB</span>. I enjoy building both backend systems and user-friendly frontends‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs a tourism guide app, a learning management platform, or a slick admin dashboard. My favorite moments are when design and logic come together in perfect harmony.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The type of work I enjoy most? Problem-solving. I love tackling challenging features, optimizing performance, and designing intuitive user experiences. I believe in writing code that not only works but is maintainable and scalable.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Outside of programming, you‚Äôll often find me exploring new places, enjoying photography, or catching up on tech news. I‚Äôm also a fan of badminton and a bit of a foodie‚Äîalways on the hunt for the next delicious street snack.
        </p>

        <p>
          At my core, I‚Äôm curious, detail-oriented, and a firm believer that learning never stops. Every project is an opportunity to grow, and I‚Äôm excited for the challenges and adventures yet to come.
